  We need to create the backend API endpoints to support the discount
  management system. Here's what needs to be implemented on the backend:

  Required Backend API Endpoints:

  1. GET /api/admin/discount-rules - Get all discount rules
  2. POST /api/admin/discount-rules - Create new discount rule
  3. PUT /api/admin/discount-rules/:id - Update discount rule
  4. DELETE /api/admin/discount-rules/:id - Delete discount rule
  5. GET /api/admin/meal-plans/list - Get meal plans for admin
  6. GET /api/admin/meal-plans/categories - Get meal plan categories
